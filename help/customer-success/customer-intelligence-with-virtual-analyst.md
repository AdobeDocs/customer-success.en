# Mastering customer intelligence with Virtual Analyst and Segment IQ in Adobe Analytics

In this article we'll start by discussing the importance of leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). Next we'll review benefits and real-world success stories from global customers using Virtual Analyst and Segment IQ to detect anomalies, avoid outliers, and maximize ROI.

## The Value of Artificial Intelligence

Perhaps you recall the time chess champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue. Experts were convinced a machine could not possibly beat human decision making and judgment in a game as complex as chess. Yet, it was done and this was key to a fundamental shift in business strategy and technological innovation as the power of artificial intelligence was unearthed.

Adobe Analytics is the core system of intelligence for the experience business, enabling anyone in the enterprise to understand and optimize customer interactions with their brand across all touch-points in real-time and at massive scale.

Adobe's AI tools are not here to replace you, but rather to enable you to achieve maximum ROI on your efforts.

## Transform Your Analytics

To evolve your analytics, we need to focus on three key considerations:

1. Organization - How to create holistic views of customers, prioritize insight-driven decisions and democratize data.

1. Technology - How to make sure data and technology deliver personalization at scale.

1. Customer - How to build trust and adapt to change.

Analytics is challenging and time-consuming, yet there is a constant need to accelerate time-to-insight. Key issues organizations face include:

* Limited organizational resources - various business goals can limit resource availability
* Limited technical expertise - can knowledge be shared and data democratized
* Customer expectations - can your team react dynamically to customer behaviors changes

### 3 Levels of Customer Intelligence

When it comes to a successful customer intelligence strategy, we need to move through three levels (see Figure 1 above) from: (a) data collection, to (b) data processing, to (c) analytics and machine learning, before we can finally take action and optimize our content and ads.

1. Data collection will depend on your organization and may include a variety of channels and mediums, such as OTT devices, video, enterprise, call centers, in-store, social email, web, ads, mobile apps, wearables, IoT, voice assistants, connected cards, and geo / spatial.

1. Data processing includes real-time data collection, processing rules, audience syndication, context-aware sessionization, real-time triggers and views, and platform.

1. Analytics and machine learning includes Segment IQ, Virtual Analyst, Segmentation, Analysis Workspace

## Real-World Success with Segment IQ**

Mobile vs Desktop: &quot;We compared hits from one of our sites to another site and quickly found a bunch of tagging inconsistencies.&quot; → Avoid data problems before a product release

Feature Usage: &quot;Customers who used our product comparison feature were 10% more likely to convert. Moving it to the top of the page grew orders.&quot; → 4% increase in conversion

Content Engagement: &quot; We discovered that visitors to our news section were twice as likely to watch video ads, so we added more video options to that section.&quot; → 7% increase in video ads viewed

Paid Search: &quot;Visitors coming from search engines were 3x more likely to upsell. We upped our spend on specific keywords as a result.&quot; → 56% upsell lift
